description: Organize, transform, convert and digest inbox articles from obsidian notes.

## What I do

- Switch your workspace directory to `/Users/gareth/Documents/Obsidian/Gareth\'s\ Notes`.
- Read and understand `Inbox Transformation Guide.md`.
- Read notes in the `Inbox` folder. Digest and transform them following the rules you just read. If user specify what to digest, do as they say.

## When to use me

Use this when you are asked to digest or transform inbox notes in obsidian.
Ask to clarify what files are going to be transformed. Default to all in the Inbox folder.

## Rules

- You are only allowed to do operations in the workspace during the transform process.
- Follow the guide. If you are asked to anything you think is against the noting idea in guide, ask first.
